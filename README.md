# RewardFireworks
Fireworks as users claim their rewards on the Steem blockchain.

## How to build
Install phaser and dsteem using npm. Use watchify (or equivalent) to bundle the scripts (set src/main.js as target) into a file called bundle.js and saved in fireworks_files/.

## How to test
Put the file fireworks + fireworks_files on a web server and visit url in browser to test. Or use a local server (I use python -m SimpleHTTPServer in console from directory of project). Or use Firefox and open the file directly.
